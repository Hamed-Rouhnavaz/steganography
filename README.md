# steganography
This code provides a simple example of how steganography can be accomplished in Python using an image’s least significant bit to store hidden information. The code naturally assumes that you’re using an image format that does not compress and alter the pixel values, which is why it saves the modified image as a PNG file, a lossless image format.
